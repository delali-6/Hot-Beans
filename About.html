        <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>Hot Beans began in 2015 when a group of university friends turned their passion for web development into a small startup. 
        Their creativity quickly attracted local businesses, helping the company grow from a rented office space into a full development 
        team by 2018. Today, Hot Beans continues to expand, embracing modern technologies, mentoring new developers, and building a strong reputation 
        for reliable, high‑quality web solutions. </p>
