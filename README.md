What to do:

Use JavaScript to say Application submitted on the Apply page
Style the .job-image and .job-content div containers
Create a back button on each of these vacancy html pages to take users back to the Vacancy main page
Make the header elements get smaller when users scroll upwards
Check if I can make the Position applied for field on the Apply page automatically fill in when users click the apply button on the job vacancy page.
